## What is the course about?

This is a 1<sup>st</sup> year undergraduate course for geoscientists taught by [Gerard Gorman](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.gorman), [Matthew Piggott](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.d.piggott) and [Christian Jacobs](http://christianjacobs.uk). It is designed to be a first introduction to numerical methods. The [Introduction to Programming for Geoscientists course](http://ggorman.github.io/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/) is a prerequisite to taking this course.

The lectures notes are written in [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). This is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document.

## Course material

All the course notes are online. Sample solutions to the exercises will be made available after each lecture. If you miss a lecture (due to illness or other good reason) then make an earnest attempt at the exercises before reading the solution or you will deprive yourself of the learning experience.

## Supplementary material

This course loosely follows the text book ["Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python 3" by Jaan Kiusalaas](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/engineering/engineering-mathematics-and-programming/numerical-methods-engineering-python-3-3rd-edition). There are many copies in the library so do not feel that you have to buy it. As explained above, you do not have to read this book to excel in this course as the online course material is self contained. However, it is a good resource if you want to broaden your understanding of the subject.
