Welcome to Numerical Methods 1. If you have somehow landed on this page now - just let me tell you that you are a little early and we are just in the process of drafting it. Check back with us soon!

This builds upon the previous course <a href="http://ggorman.github.io/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/">Introduction to programming for geoscientists</a>. As before, we will continue to use <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">IPython Notebook</a>
which is a friendly "web-based interactive computational environment where you
can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a
single document". This will allow us to develop and execute our programs alongside the lecture notes, instead of having to switch between the two, and hopefully allow you to focus on learning the numerical methods without getting too bogged down in the programming.
<br/><br/>
The full lecture series can be accessed <a href="lecture_series">here</a> if you are
revising or want to forge ahead. Otherwise follow the series of posts below
each week as we make our way through the material.
