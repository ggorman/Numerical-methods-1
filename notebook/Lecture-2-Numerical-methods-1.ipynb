We could also evaluate the RHS at some time between $t$ and $t+h$ (in the case of $t+h$ this method is called Implicit or Backward Euler) this is more complex to solve for the new $u(t+h)$ but can have advantageous accuracy and stability properties.\n",

This sum over $O(1/h)$ steps results in a global truncation error for Euler's method of $O(h)$. In other words, Euler's method is only first-order accurate -- if we halve $h$ we will need to do double the amount of work and the error should correspondingly halve; if we had a second-order method we would expect the error to reduce by a factor of 4 for every doubling in effort!\n",
