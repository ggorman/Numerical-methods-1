    "\n",
    "Notice that the value of $x$ used in the evaluation of $f$ is that at time $t$. This simple scheme is named **Euler's method** after the 18th century Swiss mathematician, Leonard Euler. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the function $f$ in this relation is evaluated at the old time level $t$ means that this is what is known\n",
    "as an explicit method -- i.e. we have all the information required at time $t$ to explicitly compute the right-hand-side,\n",
    "and hence easily find the new value for $x(t+h)$. This form of the method is therefore more correctly called either Explicit Euler or Forward Euler.  We could also evaluate the RHS at some time between $t$ and $t+h$ (in the case of $t+h$ this method is called Implicit or Backward Euler) this is more complex to solve for the new $x(t+h)$ but can have advantageous accuracy and stability properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula given is used to calculate the value of $x$ one time step forward from the last known value. The error is therefore the local truncation error. If we actually wish to know the value at some fixed time $T$ then we will have to calculate $(T-t_0)/h$ steps of the method. This sum over $O(1/h)$ steps results in a global truncation error for Euler's method of $O(h)$. In other words, Euler's method is first order.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate Euler's method, and convey the fundamental idea of all time stepping methods, we'll use Euler's method to solve one of the simplest of all ODEs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x'(t)=x $$\n",
    "$$ x(0)=1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know, of course, that the solution to this equation is $x=e^t$, but let's ignore that for one moment and evaluate $x(0.1)$ using Euler's method with steps of $0.05$. The first step is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "  x(0.05)&\\approx x(0)+0.05x'(0)\\\\\n",
    "  &\\approx1+.05\\times1\\\\\n",
    "  &\\approx 1.05\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know $x(0.05)$, we can calculate the second step:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  x(0.1)&\\approx x(0.05)+0.05x(0.05)\\\\\n",
    "  &\\approx 1.05+.05\\times1.05\\\\\n",
    "  &\\approx 1.1025\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the actual value of $e^{0.1}$ is around $1.1051$ so we're a couple of percent off even over a very short time interval and only a couple of steps of the algorithm."

    "Euler's method is first order because it calculates the derivative using only the information available at the beginning of the time step. As we observed previously, higher order convergence can be obtained if we also employ information from other points in the interval. Heun's method may be derived by attempting to use derivative information at both the start and the end of the interval:\n",

    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty with this approach is that we now require $x(t+h)$ in order to calculate the final term in the equation, and that's what we set out to calculate so we don't know it yet! The solution to this dilemma adopted in Heun's method is to use a first guess at $x(t+h)$ calculated using Euler's method:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{x}(t+h)=x(t)+hf(x,t) $$\n",

    "\n",
    "The generic term for schemes of this type is **predictor-corrector**. The initial calculation of $\\tilde{x}(t+h)$ is used to predict the new value of $x$ and then this is used in a more accurate calculation to produce a more correct value. \n",
