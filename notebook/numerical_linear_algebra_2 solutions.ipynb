    "## LU decomposition - theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we implemented Gaussian elimination to solve the matrix system with *one* RHS vector $\\pmb{b}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We often have to deal with problems where we have multiple RHS vectors, all with the same matrix $A$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We could call the same code multiple times to solve all of these corresponding linear systems, but note that as the elimination algorithm is actually performing operations based upon (the same) $A$ each time, we would actually be wasting time repeating exactly the same operations - this is therefore clearly not an efficient solution to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could easily generalise our Gaussian elimination/back subsitution algorithms to include multiple RHS column vectors in the augmented system, perform the same sequence of row operations (but now only once) to transform the matrix to upper-triangular form, and then perform back substitution on each of the transformed RHS vectors from the augmented system - cf. the use of Gaussian elimination to compute the inverse to a matrix by placing the identity on the right of the augmented system.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is often the case that each RHS vector depends on the solutions to the matrix systems obtained from some or all of the earlier RHS vectors, and so this generalisation would not work in this case. Note that an example of this you will see in NM2 is where you are time-stepping the solution to a differential equation, and the RHS vector depends on the solution at the previous time level.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with this situation efficiently we *decompose* or *factorise* the matrix $A$ in such a way that it is cheap to compute a new solution vector $\\pmb{x}$ for any given RHS vector $\\pmb{b}$.  This decompisition involves a lower- and an upper-triangular matrix, hence the name LU decomposition. These matrices essentially *encode* the steps conducted in Gaussian elimination, so we don't have to explicilty conduct all of the operations again and again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, let's assume that we have already found/constructed a lower-triangular matrix ($L$ - where all entries above the diagonal are zero) and an upper-triangular matrix ($U$ - where all entries above the diagonal are zero) such that we can write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A = LU $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the matrix system we need to solve for $\\pmb{x}$ becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A\\pmb{x} = \\pmb{b} \\iff (LU)\\pmb{x} = L(U\\pmb{x}) = \\pmb{b} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the matrix-vector product $U\\pmb{x}$ is itself a vector, let's call it $\\pmb{c}$ for the time-being (i.e. \n",
    "$\\pmb{c}=U\\pmb{x}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The above system then reads \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L\\pmb{c} = \\pmb{b} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L$ is a matrix and $\\pmb{c}$ is an unknown.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As $L$ is in lower-triangular form we can use forward substitution (generalising the back subsitution algorithm/code we developed last week) to very easily find $\\pmb{c}$ in relatively few operations (we don't need to call the entire Gaussian elimination algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know $\\pmb{c}$ we then solve the second linear system \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U\\pmb{x} = \\pmb{c} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where now we can use the fact that $U$ is upper-triangular to use our back substitution algorithm again very efficiently to give the solution $\\pmb{x}$ we require.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for a given $\\pmb{b}$ we can find the corresponding $\\pmb{x}$ very efficiently, we can therefore do this repeatedly as each new $\\pmb{b}$ is given to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our challenge is therefore to find the matrices $L$ and $U$ allowing us to perform the decomposition $A=LU$.\n"
