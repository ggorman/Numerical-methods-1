    "The conditioning (or lack of, i.e. the ill-conditioning) of matrices we are trying to invert (to obtain the inverse, or to find the solution to a linear matrix system) is incredibly important for the success of any algorithm.\n",
    "\n",

    "But what happens when we consider a matrix that is nearly singluar, i.e. $\\det(A)$ is very small?\n",

    "\n",
    "Two types/families of methods exist to solve matrix systems.  These are termed *direct* methods and *iterative* (or *indirect*) methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct methods perform operations on the linear equations (the matrix system), e.g. the substitution of one eqution into another which we performed two weeks ago for your example $2\\times 2$ system considered in MM1. This (and the subsequent Gaussian elimination algorithm) transformed the equations making up the linear system into equivalent ones with the aim of eliminating unknowns from some of the equations and hence allowing for easy solution through back (or forward) substitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in MM1 you learnt Cramer's rule which gives an explicit formula for the inverse of a matrix, or for the solution of a linear matrix system.  It was pointed out that the computational cost (in terms of arithmetic operations required; also termed complexity) scaled like $(n+1)!$, whereas the Gaussian elimination (which is basically the susbtitution method done above) scaled like $n^3$.  For large $n$ Gaussian elimination will clearly be more efficient - you considered the case where $n=100$ in MM1 for example. $n$ here refers to the number of unknowns or equations, or sometimes termed the *degrees of freedom* of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of direct methods is that they provide the exact solution (assuming exact arithmetic, i.e. ignoring the round off related issues mentioned above) in a finite number of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as pointed out previously, $n$ could be billions for hard-core applications such as in weather forecasting. In this case the $n^3$ operations required of a direct algorithm such as Gaussian elimination is also prohibitive. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to reduce this cost, ideally to a level that is (close to) linear in $n$, *iterative* algorithms were devised. \n",
    "\n",
    "These start with a guess at the solution ($\\pmb{x}_0$), they calculate the residual vector ($A\\pmb{x}_0 - \\pmb{b}$), and its norm (a scalar measure of a vector's size - e.g. the vector *2-norm* is just the square root of the sum of the squares of the components) which will obviously not be zero unless you were very lucky with your initial guess, and then *iteratively* seek to improve on this solution to drive down this residual norm.  This iteration will stop at some small (non-zero) residual norm tolerance level, yielding an approximation to the solution, but not the exact solution we would obtain with direct methods.  The residual norm tolerance stopping criteria therefore needs to be thought about carefully, e.g. depending on how accurate a solution $\\pmb{x}$ we require.\n",
